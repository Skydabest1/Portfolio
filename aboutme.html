This role allows me to meet with current, and prospective new members to show them what our organization is all about. I am in the game design club, where every semester we make a new video game where I am Lead for art team. For this spring semester I am the new Art Team Lead where I will be able to help distribute tasks, and oversee the style and art that my team will create. A new club at Illinois State is The Creative Technologies Collective, where I am the social media lead where I am able to create graphics and promote our club as well as help teach new people how to make fun and interesting graphics. I am a Creative Technologies Student Mentor for new and incoming freshman. Where I get to put on fun events and show off what opportunities Creative Technologies has to offer.
